# What is it?
`8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown` is a famous British TV shows that presents contestants with 3 different problems to solve: letters, numbers and conundrums.

# Letters
The contestants are given 9 letters in no particular order and they're tasked with constructing the longest word they can out of the given letters.

Note: you must download a word list and place it in the same directory as the javascript file. I recommend using [dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).
```
node letters.js
```

# Numbers
The contestants are given 6 numbers and a target and they have to add/subtract/divide/multiply the numbers together without using the same number twice, to reach their target goal or as close as possible.
```
node numbers.js
